                    Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

                    Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

                    h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

                Text in a pre element
                is displayed in a fixed-width
                font, and it preserves

            The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework developed by APACHE allows for the distributed processing 
            of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is 
            designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local 
            computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library
             itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a 
             highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to 
             failures.
